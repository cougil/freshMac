Fresh Mac
=========

Tired of installing manually a lot of software in *your own brand new Apple laptop*?

I'm lazy and I don't like to do repetitive tasks (I'm a developer), that's because I decided to write here my recipes for the typical software I use (in really different cases). Feel free to change it and adapt it to your own needs and also if you think I missed any important tool, please ping me and I'd love to incldue in the list ;-)

To use it just clone the repo and run it:

`./freshMac.sh`
